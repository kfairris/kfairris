## Kenny Fairris

**Web Developer | Client Support / Support Engineer**
Little Rock, AR

I’m a web developer with a strong front-end foundation and hands-on experience supporting production applications. My background includes work in **FinTech environments (banks and credit unions)** as well as an **international non-profit**, where reliability, clarity, and trust mattered as much as the code itself.

I enjoy building clean, accessible user interfaces and working closely with stakeholders to troubleshoot issues, understand real user needs, and deliver practical improvements. I’m currently seeking opportunities as a **front-end web developer** or **client / application support engineer**.

### Professional focus

* Supporting and troubleshooting web applications used by banks and credit unions
* Collaborating with teams to diagnose bugs and integrate requested features
* Communicating clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Writing maintainable, user-focused front-end code

### Technologies & tools

* **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* **Front-end:** Responsive UI development; foundational understanding of React concepts
* **Practices:** Debugging, issue triage, accessibility awareness, Git/GitHub

### Currently exploring

* Using **AI tools** to speed up problem-solving, documentation, and code comprehension
* Improving development workflows with AI-assisted debugging and refactoring
* Learning how to apply AI thoughtfully as a productivity aid, not a shortcut

### About me

I value honesty, consistency, and steady improvement over hype. I’m comfortable learning new systems, asking good questions, and contributing where I can add real value. I do my best work when I’m helping users succeed and leaving systems more stable and understandable than I found them.
